    This is a system testbench that will need the reader to verify the outputs in simulation. This stimulates the design by
    providing switch inputs with all possibilities (2^4). The reader will need to use an oscilloscope to verify led[2]'s
    frequency. Note that the HSOSC instantiation is not present. There was difficulty bringing the lattice radiant library
    into ModelSim. 

    Run "vsim -t ns topmod" in transcript to set resolution to ns on your machine. This replaces the default ps resolution.
